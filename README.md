## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RJohnPaul/Weather_Predict.git
   cd Weather_Predict
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run main.py
```

Navigate to the provided local URL in your web browser to use the app.

## Data

The app uses historical weather data for Chennai. The dataset includes the following features:

- Date
- District
- Station
- Rainfall
- Latitude
- Longitude

## Model

The rainfall prediction model is a deep neural network built with TensorFlow. It uses the following features:

- Julian date
- District (encoded)
- Station (encoded)
- Day, Month, Year
- Day of the week
- Is weekend
- Cyclical encodings of month and day

The model is trained to predict the likelihood of rainfall for a given set of inputs.

## App Structure

The app is divided into several sections:

1. **Home**: Displays quick stats and recent weather trends
2. **Predictions**: Allows users to select a date and district for rainfall predictions
3. **Data Exploration**: Provides various visualizations of the historical data
4. **Model Performance**: Shows the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics
5. **About**: Gives information about the app and allows users to submit feedback
